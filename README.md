# zoom-evsch

the sequel to the previous version of zoom automation

this time you need to do some work to set it up

open main.bat

check this website to make your own zoom protocol links (don't share them with anyone) https://medium.com/zoom-developer-blog/zoom-url-schemes-748b95fd9205 

you can scale it infinitely by adding new lines


i should also probably mention u can use the protocl link in cmd by doing

"start __your browser, firefox, google, etc...__ (protocol link)" and scheculing that to get executed every morning or something.
